**KT Volume Profile MT4** is a MetaTrader 4 (MT4) custom indicator that calculates and displays the volume profile based on a specified time period and rectangle width. The volume profile is a powerful tool used by traders to analyze the trading activity at different price levels and identify areas of support and resistance. This indicator provides a visual representation of the volume profile, making it easier for traders to make informed trading decisions.

## Key Features
- Calculates and displays the volume profile based on a specified time period and rectangle width.
- Uses two indicator buffers to store the volume data for up and down movements.
- Automatically updates the Point of Control (POC) price and displays it on the chart when it changes.
- Allows traders to drag and drop the rectangle to update the volume profile dynamically.
- Provides trading functions for placing trades and setting stop-loss and take-profit levels based on the volume profile analysis.

## How It Works
The indicator creates a rectangle object on the chart with a specified time period and rectangle width. It then calculates the volume profile by analyzing the trading activity within the rectangle. The volume for up and down movements is stored in two indicator buffers. The indicator also calculates the POC by finding the bar with the highest volume and updates it whenever the POC changes. The POC is displayed on the chart as a label. Traders can drag and drop the rectangle to update the volume profile and trigger a POC update. The indicator also provides trading functions for placing trades and setting stop-loss and take-profit levels based on the volume profile analysis.

1. Install the indicator on your MetaTrader 4 platform.
